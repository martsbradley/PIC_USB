How it works.
=============
After a transmission is completed the interrupt flag TRNIF is asserted.
The USTAT register has fields for the endpoint and the direction 
of the communication.   With that information the starting address
of the relevant Buffer Descriptor is located from the RAM memory
starting at 0x400.  

Those four bytes are pulled copied into the GPR (General Purpose
Register) USB_BufferDescriptor.  The value of USTAT is saved
into USB_USTAT.

The first byte of the BufferDescriptor is the Buffers STAT register.
When the SIE (Serial Interface Engine) has just populated the STAT
register the bits have the PID bits.  These PID bits tell if
the packet is a TOKEN_SETUP/TOKEN_IN/TOKEN_OUT.

TOKEN_IN, TOKEN_OUT instruct the device that the host wants data or 
wants to send data to the device.

TOKEN_SETUP are commands to enumerate the device and can cause
input and output.

======================================================================

PID Type

Token        (Only the host can issue token packets.)
	SETUP
	OUT
	IN   



Data
	Data0
	Data1

Handshake
	ACK
	NAK
	STALL		Only sent by the function, to indicate that it
			cannot send or receive data

IN Tokens, cause data transactions from the host to a function.
Out and Setup Tokens cause a Data transaction from a function to the host)
SETUP transactions are similar in format to an OUT, but use a SETUP rather than
an OUT PID	

DATA0 when the endpoint experiences any configuration event


Control transfers minimally have two transaction stages: Setup and Status


A control transfer may optionally contain a Data stage between the Setup and
Status stages.  Status reporting is always in the function-to-host direction.
