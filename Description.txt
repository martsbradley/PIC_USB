How it works.
=============
After a transmission is completed the interrupt flag TRNIF is asserted.
The USTAT register has fields for the endpoint and the direction 
of the communication.   With that information the starting address
of the relevant Buffer Descriptor is located from the RAM memory
starting at 0x400.  

Those four bytes are pulled copied into the GPR (General Purpose
Register) USB_BufferDescriptor.  The value of USTAT is saved
into USB_USTAT.

The first byte of the BufferDescriptor is the Buffers STAT register.
When the SIE (Serial Interface Engine) has just populated the STAT
register the bits have the PID bits.  These PID bits tell if
the packet is a TOKEN_SETUP/TOKEN_IN/TOKEN_OUT.

TOKEN_IN, TOKEN_OUT instruct the device that the host wants data or 
wants to send data to the device.

TOKEN_SETUP are commands to enumerate the device and can cause
input and output.
